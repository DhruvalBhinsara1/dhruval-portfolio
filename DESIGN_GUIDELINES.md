# Apple-Inspired Minimal Portfolio Design Guidelines

## 1. Layout & Spacing
- Use a grid-based layout for all sections, aligning content and maintaining generous, consistent whitespace.
- Set max-widths for main content (e.g., 1100px) and center sections horizontally.
- Apply uniform padding/margins between sections and cards for a breathable feel.

## 2. Color Palette
- Use a soft white or cool gray (#f8fafc, #f4f4f5, #f1f5f9) for backgrounds.
- Choose 1–2 accent colors (e.g., electric blue #3b82f6, pastel purple #a78bfa) for highlights, buttons, and links.
- Keep supporting text in neutral grays (#6b7280, #94a3b8).

## 3. Typography
- Use a modern geometric sans-serif (Inter, DM Sans, or SF Pro).
- Headings: Large, bold, increased letter-spacing, black or near-black.
- Subheadings/roles: Slightly muted accent color, lighter weight.
- Body: Medium weight, soft gray, consistent line height.

## 4. Navigation
- Sticky, minimal nav bar with left-aligned logotype and right-aligned links.
- Use a slim, sans-serif font for the logo.
- Navigation links: Small, spaced, accent color on hover, no heavy borders.

## 5. Hero Section
- Large circular profile photo with a soft drop-shadow or glow.
- Name: Very bold, black, large font, increased letter-spacing.
- Subtitle/role: Accent color, lighter weight, on a pill-shaped or softly rounded background for contrast.
- Description: On a soft card (rounded, dark charcoal or white with shadow), centered, max-width, and subtle shadow.
- “Get Started” button: Accent color border, white or transparent background, rounded, smooth hover effect.

## 6. Skills & Badges
- Display skills as a single row of uniform, vector icons (all line or all filled).
- Use badges/chips with gentle background tints, rounded, and even padding.
- Avoid harsh borders or mixed shapes.

## 7. Projects
- Cards: Rounded corners, soft shadow, white background, uniform padding.
- Title: Bold, black.
- Description: Subtle, concise.
- On hover: Slight lift and shadow, maybe a faint accent border.
- Progressive disclosure: Show more details on click or hover, not by default.

## 8. About & Contact
- Use soft, elevated cards for bios and forms.
- Inputs: Rounded, light shadow, ample spacing, subtle focus/hover effect (e.g., border glow or scale).
- Keep the form minimal—no heavy lines or boxes.

## 9. Footer
- Ultra-light, small, muted gray text.
- Minimal margin, no border or heavy background.

## 10. Visual Flourishes
- Use gentle gradients for section backgrounds or transitions (e.g., from white to a faint gray).
- All images and avatars: Circular or with a gentle radius, soft shadow.
- All transitions: Use Tailwind’s duration-200/300 and ease-in-out for smoothness.
- Avoid unnecessary outlines or boxy elements.

## 11. Responsiveness
- Use rem/em units for font sizes and spacing.
- Ensure all elements scale gracefully on mobile and desktop.

## 12. Consistency
- Use the same font(s), icon style, and color palette everywhere.
- All cards, badges, and buttons should have the same border radius and shadow style.
- Maintain a clear visual hierarchy: bold headings, subdued body, accent highlights.

## Implementation Tips
- Refine the grid background to be even softer and less prominent.
- Ensure all cards (skills, projects, about, contact) use the same shadow, border-radius, and padding.
- Use the accent color for interactive elements only (links, buttons, highlights).
- Make sure all icons are the same style and size.
- Add subtle hover/active effects to buttons and cards.
- Use a single, modern sans-serif font throughout (set in your Tailwind config or CSS).

By applying these principles, your site will feel clean, modern, and highly professional—mirroring the polish of top tech portfolios.
